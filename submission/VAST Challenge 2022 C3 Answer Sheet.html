<p class="calibri"><b>Answer:</b></p>

<p class="calibri">We analyzed resident financial health through three complementary lenses: geographic distribution, demographic disparities, and expense trajectories.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Geographic Financial Health.</b> A building-level heatmap colors each residential structure by average savings rate—red for break-even or negative, yellow for moderate, green for high savings. Figure 1 shows the city at the beginning of the dataset (April 2022), while Figure 2 shows a later snapshot. The visualization reveals scattered "red pockets" across Engagement, often bordering healthier zones. These clusters suggest localized stressors such as higher living costs or limited access to stable employment. Comparing the two snapshots shows these red zones remain persistent rather than expanding significantly, indicating chronic rather than worsening conditions in specific neighborhoods.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Wages vs. Cost of Living.</b> The "Living Gap" scatter plot places each resident by monthly income (x-axis) against cost of living (y-axis). A diagonal reference line marks break-even; residents below the line save money, those above spend more than they earn. Figure 3 shows all residents, with most clustering safely below the line, but a visible band hugs the break-even threshold. Filtering by household structure (Figures 4–5) reveals that families with children sit closer to the line than singles or couples without children, despite often having similar or higher incomes.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Cluster Patterns.</b> K-Means clustering on demographics and financial metrics surfaces three distinct resident profiles shown in the parallel coordinates plot (Figure 6): <b>Affluent Achievers (red)</b>—couples and families with very high incomes who keep costs in check; <b>Stretched Households (blue)</b>—lower-income residents with average living costs, leaving little room to save; <b>Lean Savers (orange)</b>—mostly single adults without children, with average incomes but very low costs. Figure 7 breaks down savings rates by education and household size, showing that household structure is a stronger predictor than education level.</p>

<i>Figure 6 (left): Parallel coordinates showing cluster profiles. Figure 7 (right): Savings rates by education and household size.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Expense Trajectories.</b> A stacked area chart (Figure 8) tracks average monthly income (dashed line) against cumulative expenses (shelter, food, recreation, education). Shelter dominates fixed costs; food and recreation absorb most discretionary spending. Figure 9 provides a static breakdown of city-wide expenses for a single month. Finally, Figure 10 plots savings rate against a composite Financial Stress metric—residents in the upper-left quadrant repeatedly spend more than they earn. Cluster colors confirm that Stretched Households consistently occupy the high-stress zone while Lean Savers and Affluent Achievers remain resilient.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Conclusion.</b> Financial health in Engagement is stable on aggregate but uneven across groups. The strongest predictor of financial strain is household structure: families with children face higher fixed costs and tighter margins regardless of income or education. Geographic hotspots of low savings persist over time, suggesting targeted interventions—such as childcare subsidies or localized financial counseling—could have outsized impact on the most vulnerable residents.</p>
