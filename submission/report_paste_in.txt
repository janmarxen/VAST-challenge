Answer
We evaluated employer health in Engagement by analyzing workforce stability, turnover intensity, job-to-job mobility, and short-term workforce size changes. Our analysis focuses on March–April 2022, the only period in the dataset where job transitions were observed.


Identifying Employers with Extreme Workforce Instability

The Employer Turnover Ranking (employer_turnover_ranking.pmg) highlights pronounced differences in workforce change intensity among employers. Rather than representing the full employer population, the visualization focuses on the upper end of the distribution, revealing a subset of employers with exceptionally high turnover values. In several cases, turnover exceeds 100%, reflecting intensive workforce churn amplified by small average headcounts, where repeated employee exits strongly impact the turnover metric.

Employers ranking highest by turnover also tend to exhibit elevated quit counts and strongly negative net workforce change, indicating persistent outward movement rather than balanced hiring activity. This pattern suggests localized workforce instability during the observed period, characterized by repeated employee departures rather than short-term hiring spikes.

Across the broader dataset, employers with lower turnover and minimal net workforce change display more stable employment behavior. While not all such employers are visible in the ranking view, their limited outward workforce movement and relatively consistent employee counts indicate comparatively stable organizational structures during the analyzed timeframe.



Turnover vs. Tenure Patterns

The Turnover Rate vs. Average Tenure scatterplot (turnover_vs_tenure_scatterplot.png) highlights a clear inverse relationship between tenure and turnover. Employers cluster into two dominant regimes:

High turnover and low tenure employers form an instability zone, characterized by short job durations and frequent exits.

Low turnover and high tenure employers form a stability zone, where workers remain employed for longer periods with minimal churn.

This separation suggests that workforce turnover is not evenly distributed across employers but instead concentrated among a specific subset of organizations.



Employer Stability Overview

To integrate multiple indicators, we constructed an Employer Stability Overview bubble chart (employer_stability_overview.png), encoding turnover, tenure, and workforce size simultaneously. This visualization reinforces the contrast between high-risk employers (high turnover, low tenure) and stable employers (low turnover, high tenure).

Employers of varying sizes appear in both categories, indicating that workforce size alone does not determine stability. However, high-risk employers with larger headcounts combine scale with elevated churn, increasing their potential impact on overall labor market dynamics.


Worker Mobility Between Employers

The Job Flow Sankey diagram (job_flow_between_employers.png) reveals strong asymmetries in worker movement between employers. A limited number of employers act primarily as sources of outgoing labor, while others function mainly as recipients. These directional flows illustrate how worker mobility links employers into a connected network, with instability at certain organizations contributing disproportionately to overall job transitions.


Short-Term Workforce Growth and Decline

The Employee Count Trends step-line chart (employee_count_trends_plot.png) shows that workforce size changes occur in short, concentrated bursts within the limited period where changes were recorded. Several employers experience abrupt increases followed by rapid contractions over a small number of days. Although the observed time window is short, these sharp fluctuations align with employers identified as high turnover, reinforcing the association between churn and short-term workforce volatility.


Conclusion

Overall, employer health in Engagement is highly uneven. A minority of employers exhibit pronounced instability, characterized by high turnover, low tenure, and strong outward workforce movement. In contrast, a larger group maintains relatively stable, long-term employment relationships. The concentration of turnover among specific employers suggests targeted labor market stress rather than systemic instability across the city.
