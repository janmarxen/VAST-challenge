<p class="calibri"><b>Answer:</b></p>

<p class="calibri">We analyzed resident financial health through three lenses: geographic distribution, demographic disparities, and expense trajectories.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Geographic Financial Health.</b> A building-level heatmap colors each residential structure by average savings rate: red for break-even or negative, yellow for moderate, green for high savings. Figure 1 shows the city at the beginning of the dataset (April 2022), while Figure 2 shows a later snapshot. The visualization reveals scattered "red pockets" across Engagement, often bordering healthier zones. These clusters suggest localized stressors such as higher living costs or limited access to stable employment. Comparing the two snapshots shows these red zones remain persistent rather than expanding significantly, indicating chronic rather than worsening conditions in specific neighborhoods.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Wages vs. Cost of Living.</b> The "Living Gap" scatter plot places each resident by monthly income (x-axis) against cost of living (y-axis). A diagonal reference line marks break-even; residents below the line save money, those above spend more than they earn. Figure 3 shows all residents, with most clustering safely below the line, but a visible band hugs the break-even threshold. Filtering by household structure (Figures 4 and 5) reveals that families with children sit closer to the line than singles or couples without children, despite often having similar or higher incomes.</p>

<i>Figure 5: Households without children.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Cluster Patterns.</b> K-Means clustering on demographics and financial metrics surfaces three distinct resident profiles shown in the parallel coordinates plot (Figure 6): <b>Affluent Achievers (red)</b>, couples and families with very high incomes who keep costs in check; <b>Stretched Households (blue)</b>, lower-income residents with average living costs, leaving little room to save; <b>Lean Savers (orange)</b>, mostly single adults without children, with average incomes but very low costs. Figure 7 breaks down savings rates by education and household size, showing that education level is highly correlated with the savings rate.</p>

<i>Figure 6 (left): Parallel coordinates showing cluster profiles. Figure 7 (right): Savings rates by education and household size.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Expense Trajectories & Inequality.</b> A stacked area chart (Figure 8) tracks average monthly income (dashed line) against cumulative expenses (shelter, food, recreation, education). Shelter dominates fixed costs; food and recreation absorb most discretionary spending. Figure 9 provides a static breakdown of city-wide expenses for a single month. To measure economic disparity, we compute the Gini coefficient for both income and savings rate over time (Figure 10). The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality). Our analysis shows that income inequality remains relatively stable across the 15-month period, while savings inequality is consistently higher, reflecting the gap between those who can build a safety net and those living paycheck-to-paycheck.</p>

<i>Figure 10: Gini coefficient for income (blue) and savings rate (red) over time. The formula G = (2 * sum(i * yi)) / (n * sum(yi)) - (n+1)/n measures inequality from 0 (equal) to 1 (unequal).</i>

<p class="calibri"><b>Conclusion.</b> Financial health in Engagement is stable on aggregate but uneven across groups. The strongest predictor of financial strain is household structure: families with children face higher fixed costs and tighter margins regardless of income. Education level also correlates with savings: higher educational attainment is associated with higher savings rates, although it does not fully eliminate risk for some households. Geographic hotspots of low savings persist over time, suggesting targeted interventions (such as childcare subsidies, workforce and education programs, or localized financial counseling) could have outsized impact on the most vulnerable residents.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Visual Analytics Process.</b> We started with a simple <b>Wage vs. Cost of Living scatterplot</b> to separate residents running a surplus from those in deficit. To explain the patterns we saw, we used <b>bidirectional brushing</b> to link this view with a <b>Parallel Coordinates Plot</b>, allowing us to select outliers and immediately inspect their demographics. We also applied <b>K-Means clustering</b> to define resident personas, which helped us analyze how specific household types evolved over time. For categorical variables, <b>dynamic bar charts</b> showing savings rates were essential for spotting correlations. We could have added those variables to the parallel plot, but this would have cluttered the view. We also added a <b>"With Children" toggle</b>, which instantly highlighted the cost-of-living penalty for families. To quantify inequality, we calculated the <b>Gini index</b>, giving us a concrete metric for financial disparity. All these views are synchronized via a <b>global time control bar</b>, enabling us to scrub through the timeline and observe temporal shifts. Finally, we excluded the first month of data due to anomalous "rent adjustments" that skewed the trends without adding analytical value.</p>
