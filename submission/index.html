<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Answer:</b></p>

<p class="calibri">
We looked at resident financial health from three angles: where financial stress concentrates in the city, which household groups are closer to (or past) break-even, and how income/expenses/inequality evolve over time.
</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Geographic Financial Health.</b> The building-level heatmap shows scattered “red pockets” of low savings across Engagement (Figures 1 &amp; 2). Comparing the early vs. later snapshot (Figure 1 vs. Figure 2) suggests these pockets are persistent rather than spreading, which points to chronic, neighborhood-level strain instead of a city-wide decline. A useful way to read this view is as a spatial “hotspot” scan: the pattern is uneven, but also stable.
</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Wages vs. Cost of Living.</b> The Living Gap scatter plot (Figure 3) puts wages against total living costs and makes the break-even line an immediate reference point. Most residents sit on the surplus side, but the dense band near break-even suggests many households have only a thin “buffer” month to month (Figure 3). When filtering by household type, families with children cluster noticeably closer to break-even than households without children (Figures 4 &amp; 5), even when incomes overlap—consistent with higher fixed costs.

</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Cluster Patterns.</b> Using k-means, we get three recurring “financial personas” (Figure 6): <b>Affluent Achievers</b> (high income, high savings), <b>Stretched Households</b> (low income, low savings), and <b>Lean Savers</b> (average income, low costs). The parallel coordinates plot (Figure 6) is helpful here because it shows multivariate profiles (income + multiple expense dimensions + savings) instead of forcing a single x–y story. The demographic bars (Figure 7) support the rationale: education level lines up with higher savings rates, whereas households size does not seem to have big impact on savings (Figure 7).

  <i>Figure 6 (left): Parallel coordinates showing cluster profiles. Figure 7 (right): Savings rates by education and household size.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Expense Trajectories &amp; Inequality.</b> The stacked area chart (Figure 8) tracks average monthly income (dashed line) versus the composition of expenses, making it easy to spot both seasonality and shifts in spending mix. The visible drop in both salary and expenses in the final months (April–May 2023) suggests a potential slowdown rather than just households “overspending” (Figure 8). Looking at the citywide expense composition (Figure 9) helps explain what likely drives pressure for near break-even residents: small changes in big categories can erase an already-small surplus (Figure 9). Finally, the inequality timeline (Figure 10) shows relatively stable income inequality but more volatile savings inequality, which hints that inequality changes are driven more by expense behavior and shocks than by wages drifting apart (Figure 10).

</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Why this design works.</b> These figures act as coordinated multiple views: map for spatial concentration (Figures 1–2), scatter for trade-offs and outliers (Figures 3–5), parallel coordinates for multivariate profiling (Figure 6), and timelines for trends and shocks (Figures 8–10). With brushing-and-linking, selecting a subgroup in one view and seeing it highlighted everywhere else makes the “same residents, different angles” story much easier to validate.
</p>

<p class="calibri">
<b>Conclusion.</b> Financial health in Engagement is stable on aggregate but uneven: the strongest, most consistent strain signal comes from household structure, especially families with children sitting near break-even (Figures 4–5). The end-of-period dip (Figure 8) is the main temporal warning sign, while persistent geographic hotspots (Figures 1–2) suggest that targeted neighborhood interventions could have outsized impact. Savings inequality swings more than income inequality (Figure 10), reinforcing the idea that spending pressures (not just wages) shape who falls behind.

<p class="calibri"><b>3</b> - <span class="arial">Describe the health of the various employers within the city limits. What employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of particularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Answer:</b></p>

<p class="calibri">We assessed employer health within the city of Engagement by analyzing workforce stability, turnover intensity, job-to-job mobility, and short-term changes in employee counts. Our analysis is constrained by the dataset: observed job transitions occur primarily during March–April 2022, with no additional job changes recorded afterward. Rather than indicating ongoing stability, this reflects the limits of the available data and is explicitly shown in the interface.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Workforce Instability and Turnover Concentration</b></p>

<p class="calibri">The Employer Turnover Ranking reveals strong heterogeneity in workforce change intensity across employers. The visualization focuses on the upper tail of the distribution, highlighting employers with extreme workforce churn during the observed period. Several employers exhibit turnover rates far exceeding 100%, driven by repeated employee exits relative to small average headcounts.</p>

<p class="calibri" style="text-align:center;">
<img src="./img/turnover_ranking.png" alt="Employer Turnover Ranking" style="max-width:90%; margin:10px;"><br>
<i>Figure 1: Employer Turnover Ranking highlighting extreme turnover values.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri">These extreme values do not indicate growth, but rather intense instability: employers ranking highest by turnover also show high quit counts and strongly negative net workforce change. This pattern suggests persistent outward movement of workers rather than balanced hiring and retention. In contrast, many employers experience little to no workforce change and therefore do not appear in the ranking, indicating comparatively stable employment structures.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Stability, Tenure, and Employer Risk Profiles</b></p>

<p class="calibri">The Employer Stability Overview combines turnover, average tenure, and workforce size into a single view. Employers cluster into two dominant regimes:</p>

<p class="calibri" style="margin-left:0.5in;"><b>High-risk employers</b> with high turnover and low average tenure, indicating short job durations and frequent exits.</p>

<p class="calibri" style="margin-left:0.5in;"><b>Stable employers</b> with low turnover and long tenure, reflecting sustained employment relationships.</p>

<p class="calibri">Employer size alone does not determine stability: both small and large employers appear in each regime. However, high-risk employers with larger workforces amplify their impact on city-wide employment volatility.</p>

<i>Figure 2: Employer Stability Overview showing the clustering of employers into stability regimes.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Worker Mobility Between Employers</b></p>

<p class="calibri">The Job Flow Sankey diagram illustrates directional worker movement between employers. A small number of employers act as major sources of outgoing labor, while others consistently receive workers. This asymmetry shows that workforce instability propagates through the employer network, rather than remaining isolated within individual organizations.</p>

<i>Figure 3: Job Flow Sankey diagram illustrating directional worker movement between employers.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Short-Term Workforce Fluctuations</b></p>

<p class="calibri">The Employee Count Trends visualization shows that workforce changes occur in short, concentrated bursts during the limited period with recorded transitions. Employers experiencing high turnover also exhibit abrupt rises and drops in employee counts, reinforcing the link between turnover intensity and workforce volatility.</p>

<i>Figure 4: Employee Count Trends showing workforce fluctuations during periods of high turnover.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p class="calibri">Overall, employer health in Engagement is highly uneven. A minority of employers exhibit acute workforce instability, characterized by high turnover, low tenure, and strong outward job flows. Most employers, however, show limited workforce movement and relatively stable employment relationships during the observed period. The concentration of instability among specific employers suggests localized labor market stress rather than city-wide systemic disruption.</p>
