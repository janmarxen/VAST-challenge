<p class="calibri"><b>Answer:</b></p>

<p class="calibri">We analyzed resident financial health through three lenses: geographic distribution, demographic disparities, and expense trajectories.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Geographic Financial Health.</b> A building-level heatmap reveals <b>scattered "red pockets" of low savings</b> across Engagement. Comparing snapshots (Figures 1 & 2) shows these zones are <b>persistent rather than expanding</b>, indicating <b>chronic financial stress</b> in specific neighborhoods rather than a city-wide decline.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Wages vs. Cost of Living.</b> The "Living Gap" scatter plot (Figure 3) shows most residents save money, but a visible band hugs the break-even line. Filtering reveals that <b>families with children sit closer to the break-even threshold</b> than singles or couples without children, despite often having similar incomes (Figures 4 & 5).</p>

<i>Figure 5: Households without children.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Cluster Patterns.</b> K-Means clustering identifies three profiles (Figure 6): <b>Affluent Achievers</b> (high income, high savings), <b>Stretched Households</b> (low income, low savings), and <b>Lean Savers</b> (average income, low costs). We also found that <b>education level is highly correlated with savings rates</b> (Figure 7), with graduates saving significantly more than those with lower education.</p>

<i>Figure 6 (left): Parallel coordinates showing cluster profiles. Figure 7 (right): Savings rates by education and household size.</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Expense Trajectories & Inequality.</b> A stacked area chart (Figure 8) tracks average monthly income (dashed line) against cumulative expenses. While income and expenses follow a cyclical pattern, <b>a significant drop in both salary and expenses is visible in the final months (April–May 2023)</b>, suggesting a potential economic downturn. To measure disparity, we compute the Gini coefficient (Figure 10). <b>Income inequality remains stable</b>, whereas <b>savings inequality fluctuates strongly (0.1–0.22)</b>. This indicates that <b>inequality shifts are driven by expenditure behavior rather than salary differences</b>, which remain constant relative to each other.</p>

<i>Figure 10: Gini coefficient for income (blue) and savings rate (red) over time. The formula G = (2 * sum(i * yi)) / (n * sum(yi)) - (n+1)/n measures inequality from 0 (equal) to 1 (unequal).</i>
</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Conclusion.</b> Financial health in Engagement is <b>stable on aggregate but uneven</b>. The <b>strongest predictor of financial strain is household structure</b>: families with children face higher fixed costs. <b>Standards of living appear stagnant</b>, with a concerning dip in economic activity at the end of the period. Geographic hotspots of low savings persist over time, suggesting targeted interventions could have outsized impact on the most vulnerable residents.</p>

<p class="calibri"><b>Visual Analytics Process.</b> We started with a simple <b>Wage vs. Cost of Living scatterplot</b> to separate residents running a surplus from those in deficit. To explain the patterns we saw, we used <b>bidirectional brushing</b> to link this view with a <b>Parallel Coordinates Plot</b>, allowing us to select outliers and immediately inspect their demographics. We also applied <b>K-Means clustering</b> to define resident personas, which helped us analyze how specific household types evolved over time. For categorical variables, <b>dynamic bar charts</b> showing savings rates were essential for spotting correlations. We could have added those variables to the parallel plot, but this would have cluttered the view. We also added a <b>"With Children" toggle</b>, which instantly highlighted the cost-of-living penalty for families. To quantify inequality, we calculated the <b>Gini index</b>, giving us a concrete metric for financial disparity. All these views are synchronized via a <b>global time control bar</b>, enabling us to scrub through the timeline and observe temporal shifts. Finally, we excluded the first month of data due to anomalous "rent adjustments" that skewed the trends without adding analytical value.</p>
